# Decentralized Commercial Snow Removal Service

A blockchain-based platform that automates and verifies commercial snow removal services through smart contracts.

## Overview

The Decentralized Commercial Snow Removal Service leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless, efficient system for connecting property owners with snow removal contractors. The system uses smart contracts to:

1. Register commercial properties requiring snow removal
2. Monitor weather conditions to automatically trigger service events
3. Verify qualified contractors for service provision
4. Confirm service completion and facilitate payment

## Key Components

### Property Registration Contract
- Stores essential property details (location, size, special requirements)
- Establishes service parameters and thresholds
- Links property owners to their registered locations

### Weather Monitoring Contract
- Interfaces with oracle services to obtain reliable weather data
- Automatically triggers service events when snowfall thresholds are met
- Maintains an immutable record of weather conditions

### Contractor Verification Contract
- Validates contractor qualifications and equipment
- Manages reputation scores based on service history
- Controls contractor access to service opportunities

### Service Verification Contract
- Records service completion evidence (photos, timestamps, GPS data)
- Facilitates payment upon verified completion
- Maintains service history for transparency and dispute resolution

## Benefits

- **Automation**: Removes manual coordination between property owners and contractors
- **Transparency**: All service parameters, conditions, and verification are recorded on-chain
- **Reliability**: Weather-based triggers ensure timely service without human intervention
- **Quality Assurance**: Reputation systems and verification requirements maintain service standards
- **Efficiency**: Smart contracts handle payment and verification, reducing administrative overhead
